		<h1>Lived Experiences Project </h1>
		<p>Information and entertainment is delivered to us in different forms of media. Whether it be print, video, or audible, it requires technology in order to be relayed to its audience.  My name is Kevin Willett and my area of study is Media and Information. I have been a barber for thirty years and my barbershop has always depended on media for information.  Particularly, we listen to the radio for informational “bits” to argue about! 
 I have decided to embrace and pursue my love for radio and its related technologies.</p>
	  </p>When radio comes to mind, most of us will think of an announcer (in industry terms, we call announcers “Disc Jockeys”) sitting in front of a microphone, a control board, a turntable or compact disc player, and a big antenna connected to a remotely located transmitter.  However, there is much more involved in the process of “sending” music or news out across the airwaves.  This process piqued my interest when I received my first transistor radio at six years of age and when I made my first visit to a radio station right here in Lansing, Michigan.  I decided it was time to become more involved when my daughter began broadcasting for WOCR at Olivet College for work-study activities.  I have discovered the technology that is relied upon the most in modern radio is the computer and its supporting software.</p>
	</p>Radio, by and large, is still broadcast via airwaves using the same technology developed over one hundred years ago.  This technology involves the process of breaking sound down into electrical pulses, transmitting those electrical pulses via radio-active airwaves, and finally received through a receiver that converts the electrical pulses back into sound.  This technology has been around for so long that most people have taken it for granted. Most everyone, in a civilized society, hears radio at least once a day, whether in their car, at their work place, or at home. No matter where people hear the radio they probably do not realize the technical preparation it takes to get music and information content on the air.  In general, transmitting and receiving sound has improved in terms of quality for the end user. So much so that, no one really gives radio a second thought. Most people will just assume its presence.  But for me, it is the preparation of that sound and content before it is transmitted that holds my enthusiasm for radio. This includes going beyond the airwaves and on to internet pod-casting, the wave of the future.</p>   
      </p>My current career path has led me to working with WLNZ, the radio station for Lansing Community College. My role there is to pre-record my voice during certain segments of a programed show that is “aired” for any given schedule.  I log into the station computer, open a program that schedules the news, weather, and music for that particular day. I then “insert” my voice into segments left open during a certain hour to identify the station, deliver public service announcements, event promotions, and introduce music that has either finished playing or is yet to be played.  When segments are completed, they are saved to the stations main computer and played over-the-air at a predetermined time.  Sometimes, a certain song will need audio adjustments before it can be inserted into the station’s main music library.  This requires logging into another computer, opening a program, inserting a compact disc of that song into that program, and finally the song can be “adjusted.”  These “adjustments” can include sound quality, length of the song, editing its content, and the volume at which it is played.  On occasion, I am asked to personally interview an artist or a group of artists.  Again, this requires logging in to a computer, opening, yet again, another program that only records voice-work.  The interview is recorded in its “rough form” and then saved to a “file” to be edited for air play at a later time.  The tracks of a personal interview are edited in much the same manner as music for length, content, and audibility.</p> 
     </p>How this relates to me academically is to really say how I came to enroll at Michigan State University.  In my academic past, I earned an Associate degree from Jackson Community College in Business Administration.  My studies were heavily concentrated with coursework in advertising and marketing, along with my decided major.  It was then I really began to learn the depth of the delivery of information and entertainment in the different forms of media. In one notable situation, I had to produce an advertising campaign package that involved having to use all three major forms of media, print, television, and radio.  The project was completed in teams and, fortunately, I was assigned to radio.  I was required to develop two thirty second radio commercials.  This required me to utilize program software typically used in radio stations to develop and sell the commercials we hear on the radio today.  The project was academically successful not to mention very exciting.  This led to a “discussion” between my professor and myself regarding taking a different academic path that would lead to a career in broadcasting, which would provide me with the outlet to apply the knowledge I gained in advertising and marketing.  After several years, and a little help from some friends, I finally enrolled for classes at Michigan State.</p>
    </p>My studies here at Michigan State will include learning pre-production and production techniques, designing audio, and managing projects for broadcast distribution.  Plans, along with my regular curriculum, include gaining broadcasting experience working with off-campus local broadcasters as well as our college affiliates, WDBM and WKAR.  My intentions are to learn new and efficient ways of audio production, radio show programming, on-air announcing as well as internet live-streaming and pod-casting.  The coursework involved will include learning how broadcasting technologies will continue to innovate, recreate, evolve, and continue into generations to come.  My hope is to be part of the perpetuation of radio and its advancement with the use of new technologies.</p>
    </p>Technological developments outside of my area of study have opened opportunities to technological developments relevant to broadcasting. With the development of personal mobile devices, laptop computers, and tablets, Internet streaming has become a popular form of receiving broadcasts.  This has led broadcasters, worldwide, to adventure from airspace to cyberspace. Radio stations have gone to “live-streaming” radio broadcasts and aligning themselves with mobile application providers such as iTunes©, Rdio©, and Tune-in© radio dashboards.  The relevance of these developments to my area of study is the adaptation from the broadcasting point of view.  Application of software, writing and planning of programming, and system set-up to broadcast will require keeping up with the technology involved in order to meet with audience tastes, demands, and the medium through which they tune into their devices to.  The industry that I chose to become a part of is, currently, working to keep up those developments to ensure its survival into the future. I find it exciting to be a part of those developments.</p>
	</p>I look forward to my studies here at Michigan State.  It’s been a long journey from my first transistor radio to getting studio experience in a radio station, and finally, to learning the technical processes it takes to provide information and entertainment to an audience. Hopefully, the experience gained working with the technology involved will be a fulfilling one, especially if I have anything to do with it survival.
