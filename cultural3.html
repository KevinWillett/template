			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Cultural Artifact: If I may direct your attention to one of the earliest stereotypes, your friendly barber of Mayberry. “Floyd the Barber” is portrayed in the television sitcom “The Andy Griffith Show” as a low I.Q., dimwitted sort of fellow.  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPfBeiEiWgo)  This example is virtually the beginning of formed assumption that barbers are not very intelligent.  Another example, is a scene from the movie, “Roadhouse.” (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojPVOhHhwnk) In this case a bartender is fired and his response was “What else am I supposed to do?”  The answer from the lead character was, of course, “There's always barber school.” These examples are just a few that have diminished the nobility of the industry in the minds of the public. Furthermore, barber colleges are now forced to admit candidates with lesser educational and moral character backgrounds.</p>
