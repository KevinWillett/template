			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Executive Summary:   It can be rationally assumed that most people do not give the barber industry a second thought. It has become a stereotyped business. The common assumption in today’s culture is that a person only becomes a barber or hairdresser because they lack the ability to do anything else. This is apparent even in governing institutions of every state in our union. Laws have been amended or even mitigated right out of regulations resulting in a “watered-down” industry.  In the State of Michigan, a Grand Rapids Representative had proposed, for legislation, that the requirement for Barber Licenses be stricken from state law. This became a trend in the late seventies when the State of Michigan removed from law the requirement to apprentice under a Master Barber for a predetermined amount of time before licensure examinations could be administered to any barber candidate. The result has diminished knowledge, ability, expertise, and patron protection. In general, this has made your local barber a “Village Idiot.” </p>
